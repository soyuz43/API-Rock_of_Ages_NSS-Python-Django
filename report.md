The provided project structure seems mostly organized, but there are some improvements that can be made:

1. Separate views into separate modules:
   - It is recommended to have one view per module to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
   - Create a new folder named `views` inside each app directory (e.g., `rockproject/rockapi/views`) and move related views there.

2. Reorganize URLs file:
   - Move the `include(router.urls)` line before other URL patterns.
   - Remove duplicate imports of `rest_framework` and `django.conf.urls`.

3. Rename some view classes for better clarity:
   - Change `TypeView` to something like `TypesViewSet`, as it is a more appropriate name based on the class usage.

4. Update imports in views:
   - Import necessary modules directly inside each view file instead of importing them in the parent module.
   - Remove unused imports (if any) from each view.

5. Add proper documentation for each module, class, and function to make it easier for others to understand the codebase.

The updated conceptual hierarchy would look like this:

```
rockproject
├── rockapi
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── views
│       ├── types.py
│       ├── registration.py
│       └── authentication.py
└── rockproject
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

With the above improvements, your codebase will be more organized and maintainable. Remember to follow Python's PEP8 style guide for naming conventions and indentation.

For example, after implementing these changes, your `rockapi/urls.py` file might look like this:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

from rest_framework import routers

from .views import TypesViewSet, RegisterUserView, LoginUserView

router = routers.DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register(r'types', TypesViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    path('register', RegisterUserView.as_view(), name='register'),
    path('login', LoginUserView.as_view(), name='login'),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

And your `rockapi/registration.py` might look like this:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

def register_user(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.POST['username']
        password = request.POST['password']
        user = User.objects.create_user(username=username, password=password)
        user.save()

        return redirect('login')

    return render(request, 'registration/register.html')
```

By following these steps and making the necessary changes, you will have a well-structured Django project that adheres to best practices.
